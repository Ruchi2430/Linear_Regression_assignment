# Linear_Regression_assignment
Assignment for LR - Delivery time Prediction
Problem Statement

Objective : This assignment will help you apply linear regression techniques to a real-world business scenario.By working through this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience in using regression analysis toidentify key relationships between variables, make data-driven predictions and extract actionablebusiness insights. You will also develop an understanding of how to interpret regression outputs,assess model performance and effectively communicate findings to support strategic decision-making.

Business Value: The growing demand for quick and efficient delivery in the logistics industry calls for the developmentof systems that can predict delivery times accurately. Porter, an intra-city logistics marketplace,services millions of customers daily, and optimising delivery times is crucial for improving operationalefficiency.

The objective is to build a linear regression model that can perform the following:
1. Predict the delivery time for an order based on various input features.
2. Help optimise delivery operations by providing accurate time estimates.
3. Support operational planning and resource management, allowing for more effective use ofdelivery partners.

Dataset Overview:
   Context - The Porter Parcel Delivery Times data set provides details about orders placed through Porter. Thedata has information about the orders, such as item quantity and order amount; information aboutthe store, such as category, distance from customer and market ID; and operational information,such as the number of delivery partners
